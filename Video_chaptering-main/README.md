Video Chaptering uses NLP and machine learning to automatically divide videos into chapters based on content. By transcribing the audio and analyzing the text for key themes and transitions, it creates structured, easily navigable videos. This enhances user experience by enabling viewers to quickly locate and jump to specific sections.
